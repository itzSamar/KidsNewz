# Kidz_Newz
Kidz Newz is the efficient way to get important news. 
There is a homepage with buttons that lead to several pages within the website. 
These different pages consist of different articles based on the topic you choose.
We use two different API's ( https://smmry.com/ and https://newsapi.org/ ) to load summarized articles onto a page.
We use Node.js and javascript to synchronize all of the API's.
